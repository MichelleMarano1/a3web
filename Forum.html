        <button class="accordion">How much time do I need to Study?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The online graduate GIS Graduate program at Fleming College is a Full time course and the Workload
            is quite intense. You need to dedicate alot of time outside classes for assignments and studying.
        </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Can I work a Job whilst studying the GIS program?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>As the GIS program is full time and the workload is demanding outside of classes, students find it hard to 
            work a job alongside. Students who are not working, or are working very little hours find that they have more success 
            at completing the work and time management.
        </p>

        <button class="accordion">How do online courses differ from in person?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The online GIS Graduate program has been successfully running online for many years so it is well formatted for
            delivering content through an online structure. Classes are delivered from the teachers themselves and are designed
            to be interactive. There is some group work involved throughout the course which is a great chance to
            meet new people, even though you are not there in person.
